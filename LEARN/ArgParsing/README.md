## Argument Parsing in Python3

Two standard library arg-parsing modules demonstrated here:
 * **getopt**
    - PROS: More (customizable) flexibility than argparse
    - CONS: Not as much built-in logic, so more logic coding
 * **argparse**
    - PROS: More built-in logic, so less logic coding
    - CONS: Less flexible/customizable
