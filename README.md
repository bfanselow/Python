Simple scripts written for the purpose of learning and understanding python concepts, packages, modules, etc.

* **Concepts**: some of the more powerful, but trickier concepts in Python.
    (args-kwargs, list-comprehension, list-slicing, map-function, recursion, etc.)
  
* **Packages**: simple tests of various Python packages
  - ``numpy_demos.py``
  - ``pandas_dataframe.py``

My personal toolbox of Python scripts, classes, modules, etc.
  - **MultiProcLogging**:  Create a MP.Queue() with which to write to a shared log-file from multi-process workers
