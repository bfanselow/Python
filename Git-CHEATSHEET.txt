## Import a remote repo/project to a local dir
$ git clone <project-URL>
## Example:
$ git clone https://github.com/bfanselow/SARS.git

## If changes have been made to master branch by others after you import the above, update local master branch
$ git pull

## Modify a file on local instance
## !! Don't do this if the project involves multiple contributors (see branching below)!!
$ vi <some-existing-file>
$ git add <some-existing-file>
$ git commit -m <comments about changes>  (takes a snaphsot of project)

## Add a file on local instance
## !! Don't do this if the project involves multiple contributors (see branching below)!!
$ vi <some-new-file>
$ git add <some-new-file>
$ git commit -m <comments about new file>  (takes a snaphsot of project)

## Update the master branch.
## !! Don't do this if the project involves multiple contributors (see branching below)!!
$ git push

## Create a new branch and activate/swith-to that branch
$ git checkout -b "new_test_branch"

## Push the new branch up to remote repo (for others to review, checkout, etc.)
$ git push origin new_test_branch

## See what branches exists and which one you are currently on
$ git branch

## Add a new file to the active branch
$  git add "tests/test_service.py"

## Commit (snapshot the changes)
$ git commit -m "Added new branch with tests/test_service.py"

## Push changes to remote repo (at this point the branch has NOT been merged with master. Wait till reviewed, tested, etc.)
$ git push origin new_test_branch

## Merge branch to master
$ git merge new_test_branch --no-ff

## Push newly merged master branch to remote
$  git push (this is short for "git push origin master")
